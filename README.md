# PUPPI
 Parametric Universal Programming and Process Interface

Ever wanted to create your own visual programming interface like Autodesk Dynamo® or Grasshopper®?
Now you can, with PUPPI! You can create standalone applications or use it in any package that has a Microsoft® .NET API!

The repository contains the core code as well as documentation and samples, including PUPPICAD, a full featured parametric generative standalone CAD application.

Enjoy!
